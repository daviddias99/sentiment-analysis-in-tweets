This project used NLP techniques to solve the [SemEval-2018](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2018/index.php?id=tasks)’s E-c task. The task's goal was to classify a Tweet as ’neutral or no emotion’ or as one, or more, of eleven given emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise and trust) that best represent the mental state of the tweeter.

We used NLP techniques to pre-process the data and to classify it according to the given classes such as: Näive-Bayes, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning Model using LTSM Neural Network and Word Embeddings.

For more details on the project see the ```src/``` folder.

This project was developed for the IART (Artificial Intelligence) class at FEUP. It was a group project with [Manuel Coutinho](https://github.com/ManelCoutinho) and [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).
